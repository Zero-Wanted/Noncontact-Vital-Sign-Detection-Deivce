## How It Works

1. **Sensor Technology**:
   - The system employs specialized sensors that emit and receive signals to measure vital parameters such as heart rate and respiratory rate. The sensors are positioned for optimal signal transmission and reception.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Data is gathered in real time from the sensors and processed to extract meaningful metrics.
   - Additional training data was sourced from JSON files generated by Apple Watch devices, ensuring a diverse and robust dataset.

3. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - The machine learning model uses the collected data to improve accuracy by analyzing patterns and minimizing inconsistencies in the output.
   - Preprocessed training data from Apple Watch JSON files enabled the creation of a model tailored to human vital sign variations.

4. **Final Design**:
   - The device housing includes an angled antenna that avoids obstruction and maximizes signal strength.
   - The structure is self-supporting, eliminating the need for external props during operation.

5. **Output**:
   - The processed data is displayed in an easy-to-understand format, providing real-time feedback on the userâ€™s vital signs.
